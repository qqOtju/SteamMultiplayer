# SteamMultiplayer2D

## About

This is a small 2D multiplayer platformer where players fight
 each other in a simple arena. The game was made mostly to show 
that I can build a working multiplayer game — nothing too big, 
but everything is synced and functional.

Players can move, jump, and attack. When there's only one player left, 
a new round starts.

There's also a chat where players can send messages, 
and the server sends system messages like “Player X died!” or “Next round!” 
During the match, each player’s avatar, nickname, and HP are visible to everyone.
